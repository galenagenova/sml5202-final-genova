<p> The Russian language is widely spoken and this affects the language itself. The various types of style that it holds may be quite different from each other and represent the richneess in grammar and vocabullary. Because of the high number of citizens that speak Russian, the language differs depending on the region it is spoken in, similar examples might be seen in English, Italian, Indian etc.

<p> Here we are going to focus on the variations in terms of the style of the langauge, more precisely in the steet and everyday Russian, also known as <em>colloqual</em> Russian.

<p> We shall start with few details about the Russian colloqual language. It is widely spoken by everyone each day and its construction is based on the concept of short conversation, quck chat using updates steet words and cultural refferences. Some may also call it the lang="ru"> мать language. It can also be used in taking notes, texting, debating, everyday conversation and litarure which uses the same style. In Russian linguistics, slang is seen as a non-standard informal language subsystem used by younger generations, that is people from 12 to 30 years old — a slang of schoolchildren, students, non-formal youth groups: punks, hippies, drug addicts. Because of elimination of censorship, the Russian standard language readily absorbs slang words and phrases, the main sources being the criminal slang, the slang of drug addicts and borrowings from the English language.

A complete opposite of this shall be the white-collar style, know as the business or official language. It can be ussed in writing letters and documents, laws and corporate correspondence. Rarely do people use this style in spoken language.

<p> Messaging and texting also has its completely different dictionary. When it comes to technology and social media, the Russian speaking people might seem creative when making up new words or shortening others thanks to the code in texting.
